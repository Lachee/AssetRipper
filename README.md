# AssetRipper

AssetRipper is a tool for extracting assets from Unity serialized files (*CAB-*\*, *\*.assets*, *\*.sharedAssets*, etc.) and asset bundles (*\*.unity3d*, *\*.bundle*, etc.) and converting them into the native Unity engine format.

# Donations
The original author has decided to go to a ad powered platform. If you wish to support them go to the original repo.

I (Lachee) do not support ads or any platform that uses them. I disagree with the direction the author is going. 
So i am forking this and maintaining my own version for my own personal use. This wont be nearly as updated as the original, but it wont have ads.

# Supported Versions
